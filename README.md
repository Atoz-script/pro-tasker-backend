Overview and purpose
- This backend API covers authentication, project creation, task management, and secure access control for Pro-Tasker.
- It is designed to be part of a larger, full-stack solution, with the frontend consuming the RESTful endpoints in a consistent, predictable way.
- The codebase emphasizes maintainability, testability, and security. It is structured to support future extensions such as advanced collaboration features, richer task workflows, and richer analytics.

Key goals
- Provide a secure and scalable API for user management, project handling, and task operations.
- Enforce strict access control and data validation to protect user data and project information.
- Offer a clean developer experience with predictable API responses, comprehensive error handling, and clear documentation.

Tech stack and rationale
- Node.js: A fast, non-blocking runtime for server-side JavaScript. It enables a small, efficient codebase with a familiar language across the full stack.
- Express: A lightweight and flexible framework for building RESTful interfaces. It provides a clear structure for routes, middlewares, and controllers.
- MongoDB + Mongoose: A flexible, scalable database option well-suited for document-based data like projects and tasks. Mongoose adds strong schemas and validation.
- JWT for authentication: A compact, stateless approach to user sessions that scales well across distributed services.
- Bcrypt for password hashing: A strong, proven method to store user passwords securely.
- CORS: Controls cross-origin access to the API, protecting the backend in a multi-origin environment.
- dotenv: Manages environment-specific configuration without hard-coding secrets.

Teaser for what you’ll find
- RESTful routes for authentication, users, projects, and tasks
- Middleware for authentication, authorization, error handling, and rate limiting
- Strong data validation on every request
- Safe password handling and token-based sessions
- Clear separation of concerns across controllers, models, and routes
- A path toward deployment with Docker, environment configuration, and sensible defaults

Core concepts and approach
- Resources: Users, Projects, Tasks. Each resource is modeled with a careful schema that supports real-world usage patterns.
- Ownership and collaboration: Projects belong to users or teams. Access to projects and tasks is controlled by roles and permissions.
- Data integrity: Validation occurs on input, with informative error messages to guide clients toward correct usage.
- Observability: Structure and logging are designed to support debugging, monitoring, and performance tuning in both development and production.

Why this backend exists
Pro-Tasker is a full-stack project intended to streamline project planning, task management, and collaboration. The backend acts as the trusted source of data, handling authentication, authorization, data validation, and business logic related to projects and tasks. The codebase strikes a balance between clarity and performance. It avoids unnecessary complexity while offering a solid foundation for growth. By keeping concerns separated, this backend makes it easier to add features like task dependencies, subtasks, notifications, and reporting without destabilizing the core API.

Tech stack in depth
- Node.js: The runtime chosen for its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. It handles a high number of concurrent connections efficiently, which is essential for a multi-user task management environment.
- Express: A minimal, flexible framework for building web applications. Express makes routing intuitive and keeps middleware stacks clean and composable.
- MongoDB + Mongoose: The database choice provides a flexible schema that can evolve with your needs. Mongoose brings schemas, validation, and modeling tools that help enforce data consistency.
- JWT: A compact permission mechanism suitable for modern single-page apps and mobile clients. Tokens are issued on login and checked on protected routes.
- Bcrypt: A reliable hashing function for passwords. Salt rounds provide a strong defense against rainbow table attacks.
- CORS: A critical part of securing cross-origin requests. The backend includes a configurable whitelist of allowed origins.
- dotenv: Keeps secrets and environment-specific settings out of the codebase and under version control safety rules.

Core features delivered by this backend
- User authentication: Sign-up, sign-in, and session management using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- Password security: Passwords are stored securely using bcrypt with appropriate salting.
- Access control: Role-based access control (RBAC) and resource-level permissions guard sensitive actions.
- Project management: Create, read, update, delete projects; assign ownership and collaborators.
- Task management: Create, read, update, delete tasks; link tasks to projects; support statuses, priorities, and due dates.
- Data validation: Strong input validation to prevent invalid data and reduce downstream errors.
- Error handling: Clear error messages with actionable guidance for clients.
- Observability hooks: A consistent structure that makes it easy to add monitoring and tracing later.

Architecture and design decisions
- Clean separation of concerns: The codebase is divided into models, controllers, routes, and middleware. This makes it easier to maintain and extend.
- Stateless authentication: JWT enables scalable sessions without server-side session storage.
- Defensive programming: Validation and error handling are first-class citizens. Invalid requests fail fast with helpful messages.
- Extensible data model: Schemas are designed to be extended with new fields or related resources without major refactors.
- Testing readiness: The structure supports unit and integration tests with minimal friction.

Note: This structure is representative. It may evolve as the project grows. The aim is to keep controllers focused, models expressive, and routes straightforward to read. If you explore the codebase, you should be able to map routes to controllers without heavy indirection.

Getting started: prerequisites
- Node.js: A modern LTS version (for example, Node 18 or 20). Node provides the runtime for the server and npm for packages.
- npm or pnpm: A package manager to install dependencies. npm is widely supported; pnpm can speed up workspace installations in monorepos.
- MongoDB: A locally hosted instance or a cloud-hosted one. For local development, you can use a containerized MongoDB or a GUI-based Mongo shell to interact with your data.
- Environment management: A .env file to configure secrets and endpoints. Do not commit secrets to version control.

Installation and setup (step-by-step)
1) Acquire the code
- Clone the repository:
  - git clone https://github.com/Atoz-script/pro-tasker-backend.git
- Move into the project directory:
  - cd pro-tasker-backend

2) Install dependencies
- Install Node packages:
  - npm install
- If you prefer a modern alternative, you can use:
  - pnpm install

3) Prepare environment configuration
- Copy the example environment file:
  - cp .env.example .env
- Edit the .env file to include:
  - MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/pro_tasker
  - JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
  - PORT=4000
  - NODE_ENV=development
  - CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000
  - LOG_LEVEL=info
- If you use a cloud database, replace MONGO_URI with the cloud connection string.
- Consider adding a separate JWT_REFRESH_SECRET if you implement refresh tokens later.

4) Run the app
- Start the server in development mode:
  - npm run dev
- If you prefer a production mode command, use:
  - npm start
- The app will listen on the port defined in .env (default 4000). If the port is busy, choose another one and update .env accordingly.

5) Verify the API is running
- Open a browser or a tool like curl or Postman to:
  - http://localhost:4000/api/
- You should see a friendly message or a simple health endpoint response that confirms the server is up.

6) Interacting with the API
- Authentication
  - POST /api/auth/login with payload { email, password }
  - On success, receive a JWT token to access protected routes
- User operations
  - GET /api/users/me to fetch the current user
  - PATCH /api/users/me to update profile information
- Projects
  - POST /api/projects to create a new project
  - GET /api/projects to list projects
  - GET /api/projects/:id to fetch a specific project
  - PUT /api/projects/:id to update a project
  - DELETE /api/projects/:id to remove a project
- Tasks
  - POST /api/tasks to create a new task
  - GET /api/tasks to list tasks
  - GET /api/tasks/:id to fetch a task
  - PUT /api/tasks/:id to update a task
  - DELETE /api/tasks/:id to delete a task

Environment configuration and best practices
- Use a dedicated environment file for each environment (development, staging, production).
- Keep secret keys and credentials out of the repository. Use secret managers in production.
- Rotate JWT secrets periodically and implement token expiration with a reasonable window.
- Implement strict CORS policies. Only allow origins you trust, especially in production.
- Enable rate limiting to mitigate brute force and DoS attempts.
- Use TLS in production to protect data in transit.
- Log meaningful events without leaking sensitive information. Consider log rotation and log level controls per environment.

API reference at a glance
- Authentication
  - POST /api/auth/register: Create a new user account
  - POST /api/auth/login: Authenticate a user and return a JWT
  - POST /api/auth/logout: Revoke a session (if you implement server-side revocation)
- Users
  - GET /api/users/me: Fetch the current user
  - PATCH /api/users/me: Update user details (name, avatar, etc.)
- Projects
  - GET /api/projects: List projects the user can access
  - POST /api/projects: Create a new project
  - GET /api/projects/:id: Retrieve a single project
  - PATCH /api/projects/:id: Update project properties
  - DELETE /api/projects/:id: Remove a project
- Tasks
  - GET /api/tasks: List tasks for the user or a project
  - POST /api/tasks: Create a task
  - GET /api/tasks/:id: Get a specific task
  - PATCH /api/tasks/:id: Update task details
  - DELETE /api/tasks/:id: Delete a task

Data models: a quick tour
- User
  - Fields: id, name, email, passwordHash, roles, createdAt, updatedAt
  - Important aspects: password is hashed with bcrypt; email must be unique; roles control access
- Project
  - Fields: id, name, description, ownerId, collaboratorIds, status, createdAt, updatedAt
  - Behavior: projects can have multiple collaborators; the owner has elevated permissions
- Task
  - Fields: id, projectId, title, description, assigneeId, status, priority, dueDate, createdAt, updatedAt
  - Behavior: tasks are linked to projects; statuses capture progress; priorities guide work

Security considerations
- Password storage: Always hash with bcrypt using a suitable salt factor. Do not store plaintext passwords.
- Token management: Issue JWTs with short lifetimes and consider refresh tokens for longer sessions. Store tokens securely on the client.
- Access control: Enforce permissions on server side. Do not rely on the client for security decisions.
- Input validation: Validate all inputs strictly. Use a validation library or framework features to check types, lengths, patterns, and required fields.
- Error handling: Do not leak stack traces or sensitive data in error messages. Provide actionable messages for developers while keeping user-facing errors generic.

Testing, quality, and reliability
- Unit tests: Validate models, utilities, and individual functions in isolation.
- Integration tests: Verify end-to-end behavior for authentication, project creation, and task management.
- Mocking: Use mocks for external services and database interactions to keep tests fast and reliable.
- Linting and formatting: Use ESLint for code quality and Prettier for consistent formatting.
- CI checks: Run tests on every pull request to catch regressions early.

Continuous integration and deployment
- CI/CD workflow
  - Lint and unit tests on every push
  - Integration tests on PRs
  - Build artifacts for release branches
  - Optional: static type checks if TypeScript is introduced later
- Deployment options
  - Docker-based deployment for consistency across environments
  - Kubernetes for orchestration in larger setups
  - Cloud-hosted MongoDB for reliability and scalability
  - Environment-specific configurations for production versus development

Docker and containerization
- Dockerfile: Build a minimal Node.js image with the app and its dependencies
- docker-compose: Compose services for app, database, and optional tools
- Secrets management: Use environment variables or a secret management solution in containers
- Health checks: Implement simple health endpoints to signal readiness and liveness
